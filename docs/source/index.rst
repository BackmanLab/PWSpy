PWSpy
=========

PWSpy is a Python library for working with Partial Wave Spectroscopic Microscopy data. It provides a concise and simple interface for
loading and analyzing experimental data. Support for modern as well as legacy file formats of PWS data is provided.

With PWSpy, it is trivial to skip to skip the basics and get to the heart of extracting meaningful results from your experimental data. Basic operations such as normalization, hardware compensation, and calibration are handled with the call of a single method. Additionally, the library provides a means for conveniently loading and storing auxiliary data such as ROIs, notes, and analysis outputs.

Utility functionality for generating visualizations, automatic colocalization, calculation of thin-film reflectance based on fresnel equations, parsing metadata from the graph-based acquisition engine, and more are provided in the utility subpackage.
