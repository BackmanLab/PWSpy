        zero-lag is equal to 1.0 (c[0] = 1.0).  The same process without
        normalization is the autocovariance.

        A fast method for determining the autocovariance of a signal with
        itself is to utilize fast-fourier transforms.  In this method, the
        signal is converted to the frequency domain using fft.  The
        frequency-domain signal is then convolved with itself.  The inverse
        fft is performed on this self-convolution, yielding the
        autocorrelation.

        In this instance, the autocorrelation is determined for a series of
        lags, Z. Z is equal to [-P+1:P-1], where P is the quantity of
        measurements in each signal (the quantity of wavenumbers).  Thus, the
        quantity of lags is equal to (2*P)-1.  The fft process is fastest
