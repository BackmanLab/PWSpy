# PWSPython

A python module supporting operations related to Partial Wave Spectroscopy.

The ImCube class represents a single 3d (x,y, lambda) pws acquisition and includes methods useful to analysis of pws data.

The reflectance helper can provide the reflectance spectra of any 2 materials included in its library.

The flat field visualizer is intended to show how the pws signal of a thin film acquisition varies accross the field of view.

Utility provides useful function for parallel loading and processing of ImCube files.
